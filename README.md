# COVID-19 Vaccination Slot Booking Script

## Update:

### **We are getting all kinds of attention now - which I do not want to handle. So there won't be any additional commits to this project. It has been put on indefinite hold.**

### Important:

-   This is a proof of concept project. I do NOT endorse or condone, in any shape or form, automating any monitoring/booking tasks. **Use at your own risk.**
-   This CANNOT book slots automatically. It doesn't skip any of the steps that a normal user would have to take on the official portal. You will still have to enter Captcha.
-   Do NOT use unless all the beneficiaries selected are supposed to get the same vaccine and dose.
-   There is no option to register new mobile or add beneficiaries. This can be used only after beneficiary has been added through the official app/site.
-   API Details (read the first paragraph at least): https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2
-   BMC Link: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pallupz
-   And finally, I know code quality isn't great. Suggestions are welcome.

### Noteworthy Forks

-   https://github.com/bombardier-gif/covid-vaccine-booking : I haven't tried this personally but, it looks like a promising, completely automated solution that would require a bit more setting up.

### Usage:

For the anyone not familiar with Python and using Windows, using the `covid-vaccine-slot-booking.exe` executable file (EDIT: EXE is not working at the moment due to unresolved errors) would be the easiest way. It might trigger an anti-virus alert. That's because I used `pyinstaller` to package the python code and it needs a bit more effort to avoid such alerts.

OR

Use **Python 3.7** and install all the dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the script file as show below:

```
python src\covid-vaccine-slot-booking.py
```

If you're on Linux, install the beep package before running the Python script. To install beep, run:

```
sudo apt-get install beep
```

If you already have a bearer token, you can also use:

```
python src\covid-vaccine-slot-booking.py --token=YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
```

### Third-Party Package Dependency:

-   `tabulate` : For displaying data in tabular format.
-   `requests` : For making GET and POST requests to the API.
-   `inputimeout` : For creating an input with timeout.
